Egyptian Real Estate Sector: Risk & Recovery Analysis (2020–2023)📌 Project OverviewThis project performs a quantitative risk analysis of the Egyptian Real Estate sector during a period of high systematic risk (the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent inflationary period).The goal was to analyze the resilience, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns of Egypt's leading real estate developers. By normalizing price data to a base-100 scale, the analysis visualizes how different market leaders reacted to the March 2020 crash and identifying which companies generated the highest "Alpha" during the recovery phase.🎯 ObjectivesStress Testing: Analyze sector performance during a "Black Swan" event (COVID-19).Comparative Analysis: Compare relative performance using Rebased (Normalized) Price charts.Risk Metrics: Calculate Annualized Volatility and Sharpe Ratios to identify the most efficient assets.📊 Assets Analyzed (EGX Tickers)The portfolio consists of the top market-cap real estate companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX):TMGH.CA (Talaat Moustafa Group)EMFD.CA (Emaar Misr)PHDC.CA (Palm Hills Developments)OCDI.CA (SODIC)HELI.CA (Heliopolis Housing)ORHD.CA (Orascom Development Egypt) - Added for exposure to Tourism/Hotel sector risk.MASR.CA (Madinet Masr) - Added for heavy East Cairo land bank exposure.🛠️ Methodology & Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlibKey Quantitative Steps:Data Ingestion: Automated fetching of daily historical closing prices (Jan 2020 – Jan 2023).Normalization: Prices rebased to 100 ($P_t / P_0 * 100$) to allow for "Apples-to-Apples" comparison of price movements regardless of nominal share price.Risk-Free Rate: Assumed a conservative average risk-free rate ($R_f$) of 15% based on CBE treasury yields during the analysis period.Metric Calculation:Annualized Volatility: $\sigma_p \times \sqrt{252}$Sharpe Ratio: $(R_p - R_f) / \sigma_p$🚀 How to RunInstall Dependencies:Bashpip install yfinance pandas matplotlib numpy
Run the Script:Bashpython real_estate_analysis.py
Output:The script prints a comparative DataFrame of Returns, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratios.It automatically saves a high-resolution visualization as Real_Estate_Plot.png.📈 Key InsightsVolatility Clustering: All assets showed high correlation during the Q1 2020 drawdown (Systematic Risk).Sector Divergence: OCDI and TMGH demonstrated superior recovery trajectories compared to HELI, suggesting stronger fundamental resilience.Tourism Impact: ORHD exhibited distinct volatility patterns due to its exposure to the hospitality sector during global lockdowns.
